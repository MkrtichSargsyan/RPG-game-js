## About the game


> The game is about a lonely knight that fell into an island on which there are lots of bandits. He can cut the trees and destroy other objects and get a 50 score, also he can kill the bandits and get 200 scores for every bandit.

> Gameplay is Extremely simple. You move around with WASD(W-Move up, A-Move left, S-Move down, D-Move Right) keys, as usual, 
> and left-click for the attack. Try to get as many points as you can, before you die.

> Good Luck!
